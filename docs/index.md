    <h2>Carefully built for Laravel</h2>
    <p>
        Herodot takes every piece of a Laravel app under consideration: From clever route parsing, API resource, policy, and built-in middleware support to
        integration with Passport, Fortify, Sanctum, Scout and others. The more you stick to standards, the better it gets.
    </p>

    <h2>Adapts to your way of documenting</h2>
    <p>
        Herodot provides strategies for PHP8+ attributes, OpenAPI annotations, documentation comments, external data sources, or just source code parsing. 
        No matter <em>how</em> you prefer to document your API, Herodot will understand it.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Fully extensible</h2>
    <p>
        Herodot uses fully isolated phases, making it possible to extend and swap out implementations like Lego bricks. Events are emitted throughout the entire
        process, so you can hack it to your hearts content.
