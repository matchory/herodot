Documenting your API
====================
Herodot supports several different ways to add metadata to your endpoints. We call them _strategies_.  
This package ships with several different strategies (but you can easily [add your own](#adding-an-extraction-strategy)): PHP Attributes, documentation
comments, OpenAPI annotations (thanks to [zircote/swagger-php](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php)), static analysis and overrides from your
configuration file.

The preferred way to document your API with Herodot is using [PHP attributes](https://stitcher.io/blog/attributes-in-php-8). This allows a fluent, simple, and
discoverable way to add endpoint metadata by adding attributes:
```php
#[Title('Retrieves a user')]
#[UrlParam(name: 'user', description: 'UUID of the user')]
public function single(User $user) {
    // ...
}
```

### PHP Attribute Extraction
**Attribute inheritance:**  
Attributes can also be set on controllers, causing them to be inherited by all of its methods. This makes it easy to share common attributes by adding them to a
base class, or setting a group on controllers.

#### Title (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Title`)
Adds a title to the endpoint. This attribute only has a single parameter for the title text. The title is intended to be used for single-line headings, and thus
you should expect line breaks to be removed.
```php
#[Title('Endpoint title')]
```

#### Description (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Description`)
Adds a description to the endpoint. This attribute only has a single parameter for the description text. In contrary to the title, the description can take any
length. All long-form text will be parsed as markdown (with HTML support) later on, just keep in mind that some output formats may not provide formatting
options or do not support all of them.
```php
#[Description("This is\na description text.")]
```

#### Group (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Group`)
Adds the endpoint to a group. By default, all endpoints are in a group with an empty name, but by adding the `Group` attribute to an endpoint, you can move them
into another group. This allows an easy way to add structure to your documentation, for example by grouping all user endpoints.  
Endpoints may only be added to a single group. If you're looking for a way to _tag_ endpoints instead, take a look at the
[Meta Attribute](#meta-matchoryherodotattributesmeta).
```php
#[Group('Example endpoints')]
```

The `Group` attribute allows including arbitrary metadata as a key-value map:
```php
#[Group('Example endpoints', [
    'key' => 'value'
])]
```
Metadata will be stored alongside the attribute and may be used differently depending on the output printer.

#### Hidden (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Hidden`)
Marks the endpoint as hidden, subsequently omitting it from the documentation output--unless, that is, you use an output target that explicitly includes hidden
routes (which may be useful for internal developer docs, for example).
```php
#[Hidden()]
```

You can optionally specify a reason. It may be shown depending on the output printer.
```php
#[Hidden('An optional reason')]
```

#### Internal (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Internal`)
Marks the endpoint as internal. Internal endpoints should not be relied upon by end users, because they may be changed or removed at any time, but should still
appear in your documentation for one reason or another.
```php
#[Internal()]
```

You can optionally specify a description:
```php
#[Internal('An optional description')]
```

Additionally, the `Internal` attribute allows including arbitrary metadata as a key-value map:
```php
#[Internal(meta: [
    'key' => 'value'
])]
```
Metadata will be stored alongside the attribute and may be used differently depending on the output printer.

#### Deprecated (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Deprecated`)
Marks the endpoint as deprecated. Deprecated endpoints should not be used anymore and may be removed in a future version.
```php
#[Deprecated()]
```

You can optionally specify a reason:
```php
#[Deprecated('An optional reason')]
```

You can also optionally specify a version since which the endpoint is deprecated:
```php
#[Deprecated(version: '2.5.2')]
```
Herodot does not (yet) include actual support for API versions due to the complexity involved. We're all ears for your ideas, though!

Additionally, the `Deprecated` attribute allows including arbitrary metadata as a key-value map:
```php
#[Deprecated(meta: [
    'key' => 'value'
])]
```
Metadata will be stored alongside the attribute and may be used differently depending on the output printer.

#### Authenticated (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Authenticated`)
#### Unauthenticated (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Unauthenticated`)
#### Accepts (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Accepts`)
#### Header (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Header`)
#### URL Parameters (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\UrlParam`)
#### Query Parameters (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\QueryParam`)
#### Body Parameters (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\BodyParam`)
#### Response (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Response`)
#### ResponseFile (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\ResponseFile`)

#### Meta (`Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Meta`)
Adds arbitrary metadata to an endpoint. This provides for a good way to extend Herodot in ways you see fit, without having to write an extension.
```php
#[Meta('Key')]
```

You may optionally pass an arbitrary value (it's annotated as `mixed`):
```php
#[Meta('Key', 'value')]
```

#### Hiding endpoints from your documentation
Usually, you can hide endpoints by excluding their route. To go the other way around, and exclude a route from its handler, you can mark it as hidden. This will
cause the endpoint to be omitted from the documentation output--unless, that is, you use an output target that explicitly includes hidden routes (which may be
useful for internal developer docs, for example).

- **Attributes**  
  Add the `Matchory\Herodot\Attributes\Hidden` attribute to the route handler:
  ```php
  #[Hidden]
  ```

  To specify an optional reason, pass it to the attribute:
  ```php
  #[Hidden('An optional reason')]
  ```
- **Documentation Tags**  
  Add the `@hidden` tag to the documentation comment:
  ```php
  /**
   * @hidden
   */
  ```
  To specify an optional reason, add it to the tag:
  ```php
  /**
   * @hidden An optional reason
   */
  ```
- **Overrides**  
  Add the `hidden` override to the endpoint:
  ```php
  'route.name' => [
    'hidden'=> true
  ]
  ```
  To specify an optional reason, set it to a string value:
  ```php
  'route.name' => [
    'hidden'=> 'An optional reason'
  ]
  ```
- Code Inference:
  _This must be enabled using the [#]() flag._ Prefix the method with an underscore:
  ```php
  public function _hiddenMethod()
  ```
  Using code inference only, it isn't possible to add a reason.
